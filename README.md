Present an analytical study of solving traveling salesman problems using simulated annealing, exploring the performance of SA across various map sizes, and focusing on how different cooling schedules and the lengths of the Markov Chains affect convergence behavior. Results show a slowdown in the convergence rate of the annealing process, particularly evident as the scale of the map increased. Different cooling schedule can significantly affect the performance of SA. Linear cooling tends to converge quickly initially but may stuck as it approaches a local minimum; exponential cooling has more controlled convergence, balancing exploration and exploitation by allowing more extensive searching at the start and then finer tuning as annealing process; logarithmic cooling can converge to a good solution very quickly, but the slow temperature decrease later on means the annealing process spends a lot of time fine-tuning. The Markov chain length has no significant impact on the convergence of the 280 cities TSP problem.
